The total events indicates the number of dates when litter and debris were collected and enumerated at a site. The total lbs shows the total weight of all items collected for all events at a site.\nAll litter and debris were sampled using the ETAP method. Litter includes items that can be assigned to an ETAP category and debris includes items without a category (usually large, specific items). For each site and date, only a subset of litter and debris is categorized if the total amount collected exceeds two bags. ETAP provides an overview of the ratios of each type of material found at a site, whereas the total weight is the weight of all the litter and debris found in the device at the collection date."
