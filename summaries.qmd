## Totals

These plots show summaries of the total weight of litter and debris as trash or recyclables that were collected to date for all sites.

```{r}
column(12,
  column(3,
    download_file(
      path = here('figs/totlbs.jpg'),
      output_name = "total-summary",
      output_extension = ".jpg",
      button_label = "Download plot",
      button_type = "warning",
      has_icon = TRUE,
      icon = "fa fa-save"
      )
  )
)
```

```{r, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('figs/totlbs.jpg'))
```

```{r}
column(12,
  column(3,
    download_file(
      path = here('figs/totlbscos.jpg'),
      output_name = "total-summary-counties",
      output_extension = ".jpg",
      button_label = "Download plot",
      button_type = "warning",
      has_icon = TRUE,

      )
  )
)
```

```{r, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('figs/totlbscos.jpg'))
```

## Totals by site

This plot shows the type of litter and debris counted at each site and event.  The summaries show the total count divided by the number of events at each site, with colors showing the magnitude. Note that reported counts at a site are from a subset of the total bags collected at a site and date if more than two bags were collected.  The tables provides an overview of the types and not quantities.  

```{r}
column(12,
  column(3,
    download_file(
      path = here('figs/cardplo.jpg'),
      output_name = "inventory",
      output_extension = ".jpg",
      button_label = "Download plot",
      button_type = "warning",
      has_icon = TRUE,
      icon = "fa fa-save"
      )
  )
)
